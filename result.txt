    Comments on ImageCLEF12 dataset:
        - Phillyrea angustifolia is the main reasons why evaluated accuracy on test dataset is low.
        - Imbalance data between test and train dataset; and between each species.
        - Oversampling by simply copying did not show better results.
        - The impact of schedule learning rate is decent.
        - EfficientNetB4 has even shown worse results, several possible reasons:
            + overfitting
            + imabalance nature of test dataset -> very low accuracy on dataset compared with train dataset
            + bugs or bad scripts (implementation problems) are very unlikely
        - Many papers using ImageCLEF12 dataset and giving high accuracy reduced dataset to only several species or chose only scan/scan-like images. Other than that, highest accuracy is likely to be 61%
        - This dataset (ImageCLEF12) is losing its interests based on the fact that there are no recents papers using ImageCLEF12 dataset
    TODO: 
        - Try greyscaling
        - Combining test with train dataset and split in order to balance test and train data
